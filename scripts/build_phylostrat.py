"""
Adds the genEra context that build_data.py does not carry: ambiguous-stratum flags, founder
events, and the per-stratum ladder used by the module overview.

PATCHER -- runs after build_data.py. See README "Build order".

Why ambiguity matters enough to ship: genEra emits a separate file listing genes whose
phylostratum it could not resolve to one node (29 HAP1 + 15 HAP2). Those genes still carry a
rank in gene_ages.tsv, so without this flag a reader sees a confident stratum for a gene the
method itself flagged as uncertain. For a chapter whose thesis rests on PS >= 18, that is
exactly the wrong place to look confident.
