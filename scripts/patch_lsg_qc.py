"""Per-gene QC flags on every gene of the LSG pool: abSENSE and the synteny window search.

RULING (Chen, 2026-09-21 evening, reconfirmed 2026-09-26; ms2-lsg docs/CORRECTIONS.md C5): the
pool is the rerun that added Idesia, 776 HAP1 + 835 HAP2, and "only AbSENSE and synteny check are
the QC steps". A flag never changes the pool. Two flags, as ms2-lsg's own
pipeline/out/lsg_pool_flags_newpool.tsv (s00c) defines them:
  abs   abSENSE rejects the young call: the absence is plausibly a detection failure
        (84 HAP1 + 106 HAP2)
  ret   the syntenic-window search (tblastn) finds a strong hit inside an annotated gene of an
        outgroup (96 HAP1 + 104 HAP2)
  post  neither flag: the chapter's post-QC set, used for its group comparisons (602 + 635)
check_ms2_canon.py compares all three with that table, gene by gene.

WHAT C5 REMOVED, and why each is gone rather than renamed:
  rr    "falls below rank 18 in the Idesia rerun" was a flag only while the frozen call was the
        pool (C4). The rerun IS the pool now, so the 114 genes it described are not pool genes
        and carry no QC record; their gene page says they left the pool, from ps.frz.
  wgd   whole-genome duplication is no longer a QC flag (C5). Duplication is its own analysis on
        MS1's classification, which the Duplication card already shows.

KEPT AS OTHER EVIDENCE, not QC flags: the synteny-contest routes (syn_og, syn_twin, syn_any, from
ms2-lsg lsg_pool_synteny.tsv, which C5 names as part of the synteny checks but s00c keeps out of
`unflagged`), the short-ORF class (short, plen) and DIAMOND-sensitivity stability (stable). The
card lists them under the flags and never folds them into `post`.

Constraints, checked here rather than trusted:
  1. Flags, not filters. The pool is set by patch_lsg_pool.py; this adds `qc` to exactly the
     genes it put in the pool, and asserts every pool gene has a source row.
  2. abSENSE fields are copied as-is (hdf flag, verdict string), never re-derived into a yes/no
     "is this gene old" claim; the card renders the flag names, and the calibration travels in
     manifest.lsg_qc.
