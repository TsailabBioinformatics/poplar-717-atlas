# The data build, in the ONE order that produces a complete data/ directory.
#
# TWO THINGS MAKE THIS SCRIPT NECESSARY, and both have already caused real damage:
#
#   1. build_data.py WIPES and rewrites data/genes/; every later stage PATCHES those shards.
#      Run out of order, or run alone, and you get a plausible-looking data/ that is silently
#      missing layers.
#
#   2. NO SINGLE MACHINE CAN RUN EVERY STAGE. The core stages read Sapelo2-local sources
#      (/scratch, /work). Four later stages read the OneDrive MS1_2026 tree, which is on
#      Chen's Mac and is NOT mounted on Sapelo2. So a complete build is a two-machine
#      sequence, and this script refuses to start a build it cannot finish -- BEFORE
#      build_data.py destroys the layers this machine would be unable to restore.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/build_all.sh                  full build; aborts unless every stage can run here
#   scripts/build_all.sh --allow-partial  run only the stages available here (see warning)
#
# Two-machine sequence, when no one machine has both source trees:
#   Sapelo2 : scripts/build_all.sh --allow-partial   then commit and push
#   The Mac : git pull && scripts/build_all.sh --allow-partial   then commit and push
# The second machine's run re-applies its own stages and finishes with the facet index.
