"""
Builds data/index/facets.json -- one compact row per gene, in the SAME ORDER as
index/genes.json, holding every field the browse view can filter or sort on.

Why a separate index at all: filtering 63,960 genes by "PS >= 18 and private and tau >= 0.8"
would otherwise mean fetching all 39 gene shards (39 MB) and 257 expression buckets (208 MB).
The facet index is ~2 MB raw / ~500 KB gzipped and is the only thing browse loads.

Encoding is positional, with the vocabularies inlined, so the file stays small and needs no
schema knowledge on the client beyond `cols`.

PATCHER ORDER: runs LAST -- it reads fields written by all three earlier builds.
