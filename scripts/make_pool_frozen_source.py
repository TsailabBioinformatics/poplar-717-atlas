"""Write sources/lsg_pool_frozen.tsv.gz: the frozen genEra call for every gene, label-free.

WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-09-21). Chen ruled that the LSG pool is the frozen genEra call, 842 HAP1 +
883 HAP2, and that it does not change; every check on it, the rerun that added Idesia included,
is a per-gene flag (MS2_2026 CLAUDE.md, commit 1e698f2). The atlas had swapped that call out on
2026-09-10 for the rerun's ranks, and in doing so overwrote the frozen call's taxonomic
representativeness (`ps.tr`) on 1,251 genes. build_phylostrat.py writes the frozen call in a full
build, but a full build cannot run on one machine, so the in-place correction needs the frozen
values from a committed source. This is that source.

WHERE IT COMES FROM. ms2-lsg `pipeline/out/lsg_pool.tsv`, read through git at the commit pinned in
sources/ms2_canon.pin.json, so the local ms2-lsg checkout's branch does not matter. That table is
the frozen pool the chapter reports. Two things are done to it, both asserted:
  * `canonical_label` and `group` are dropped. They carry the unpublished candidate names.
  * One gene appears on two rows because it carries two canonical labels. The rows are identical
    once the labels are dropped (asserted), so they collapse to one.

GATES, all of which must pass or nothing is written:
  * 63,960 genes, and the pool is exactly 842 HAP1 + 883 HAP2.
  * rank and is_lsg equal the frozen_rank and frozen_is_lsg columns of the rerun table
    (lsg_pool_idesia.tsv.gz) for every gene: two ms2-lsg tables, one frozen call.

NOT A BUILD STAGE. Like the other make_*_source.py scripts it regenerates a committed source by
hand; the stage that applies it is patch_lsg_pool.py. Needs a clone of ms2-lsg (private).
