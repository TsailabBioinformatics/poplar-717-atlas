"""
Adds the P. trichocarpa syntenic ortholog for each 717 gene.

Source is THIS ATLAS'S OWN GENESPACE run (job 47798208), which was QC'd in this project --
not an imported table. That matters after the 2026-09-05 audit: every external layer had to be
checked against a repo's canonical/superseded statements, whereas this one is ours.

Why it is worth having: P. trichocarpa is the reference Populus genome, so a Potri id is the
key that unlocks Phytozome and PopGenIE for a visitor holding a 717 gene. That is exactly the
lookup a community user arrives wanting.

Only reciprocal 1:1 pairs are published. Where a 717 gene hits several Potri genes (or vice
versa) the relationship is recorded as ambiguous with its multiplicity rather than resolved by
picking the top hit -- an arbitrary pick would read as a confident ortholog call.

PATCHER -- runs after build_data.py, before build_facets.py.
