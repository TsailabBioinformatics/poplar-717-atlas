"""Build sources/chromatin_ptri.tsv.gz -- accessible chromatin and histone marks at the
Populus trichocarpa ortholog's promoter, from GEO GSE128434 (Schmitz lab, Nature Plants 2019).

WHOSE PROPERTY THIS IS. The analysis runs entirely inside P. trichocarpa: peaks called on
trichocarpa leaf, scored against trichocarpa gene starts. Nothing here was measured on 717,
and no 717 chromatin data exists. So this ships as a property OF THE ORTHOLOG, rendered as
such, and never as a statement about the 717 gene's own promoter. Carrying it across the
ortholog edge as a 717 property would assert promoter synteny that a reciprocal-ortholog
call does not establish.

THE DENOMINATOR IS LOAD-BEARING, and is shipped for the same reason the proteomics layer
ships detectability. The chromatin is LEAF ONLY. A gene silent in leaf correctly has no
promoter mark there, so a mark's absence is uninterpretable unless you know the gene was
expressed. The source analysis's first run failed its own gate for exactly this reason, plus
a window that was too narrow -- 55% of conserved gene starts have their nearest accessible
region more than 2 kb away, which is that paper's own headline finding about distal elements
in plants. Both corrections are baked into the table this reads.

GATE. Reproduces the analysis's published numbers before writing: the conserved leaf-expressed
H3K4me3 rate (81.5%) that its own gate turns on, and all eight cells of its Populus-specific
versus matched-conserved effect table. Nothing is written if any of them moves.
