"""TODO: RNA-seq gene-model evidence -- intron support, and the split-model flag.

Two layers from one source (ms2 piggyback_rnaseq_junctions, out_idesia, 94-library frozen
panel, corrected pool). Both are FLAGS, never filters.

  gm.in   {n, seen, rd}  annotated introns, how many were observed, and the gene's read count
  gm.np / gm.nev         adjacent pairs, and how many were deep enough to test at all
  gm.sp   {...}          the strongest flagged pair, only when one exists

WHY THE READ COUNT AND THE PAIR COUNTS ARE NOT OPTIONAL. Intron detection is a function of
depth: under 20 reads the per-intron detection rate is below 27%, over 5,000 reads it is 98.8%.
LSG genes are shallow. So "3 of 5 introns seen" for an LSG is mostly a statement about its
expression, and shipping it without the depth and the power curve would read as evidence
against LSG gene models -- which the data does not support. Likewise 17,528 pairs were too
shallow to test, so a gene with no split flag may simply never have been testable, and
`nev` is what lets the card say which.

THREE GATES:
  1. n_introns must equal the atlas's OWN gs.in for every gene -- the source and the atlas
     derive it independently (spliced-read pipeline vs the v5.1 GFF3 longest isoform) and they
     agree 50,631/50,631. If they ever diverge, the two are describing different gene models
     and neither layer should ship.
  2. exactly 2,629 genes carry a split flag.
  3. every flagged gene's partner is a real atlas gene.
