"""Write sources/founder_families_rerun.tsv.gz: each gene's founder family, from the pool's run.

WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-09-26). The gene card's family origin (`ps.fnd`) came from the frozen
2026-04 genEra run while the gene's own rank comes from the rerun that added Idesia (the pool
since C5). Two runs joined let a family look younger than one of its own members, which cannot
happen inside one run, on 419 genes. ms2-lsg now carries the rerun's own founder families
(`data/founder_families_rerun_20260926/`, built by the "ms2 sapelo2" session at this atlas's
request), so family origin and gene age come from the same run again.

WHERE IT COMES FROM. That table, read through git at the commit pinned in
sources/ms2_canon.pin.json, checked against the pinned git blob AND the pinned sha256 (the owner
read both back from origin/main). Dropped before shipping: `gene` (the transcript name; `gene_id`
is the join key) and `family_id` (the owner's own hash of the member list, meaningless outside
that file, so it must not look like an identifier a reader could look up).

GATES, all of which must pass or nothing is written:
  * 63,954 rows, gene_id unique, 15,040 families, 32,134 HAP1 + 31,820 HAP2 (the owner's README).
  * Within one run a family is never younger than a member: family_rank <= gene_rank on every
    row that has a gene_rank, and family_rank equals the family's oldest member rank.
  * family_size equals the family's row count.
  * gene_rank equals the pool call's rank (lsg_pool_idesia.tsv.gz, pinned) on every gene that has
    one: this is what makes the two fields one run, not merely a newer file.

NOT A BUILD STAGE. Regenerates a committed source by hand; the stage that applies it is
patch_founder_rerun.py. Needs a clone of ms2-lsg (private).
