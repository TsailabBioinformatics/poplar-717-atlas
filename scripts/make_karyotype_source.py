"""Copy the MS1 gamma-branch route C labels into sources/: where each 717 gene sits in the
ancestral eudicot karyotype (AEK; Wang et al. 2022, BMC Biology 20:216), and which gamma copy and
salicoid copy it descends from.

EXPLORATORY, NOT A CURATED CALL. The gene-level WGD events (S salicoid, A gamma) stay the
duplication call; this layer shows ancestral topology beside them.

Route C, as the owning analysis defines it (gate 2 re-derives it from its own helper columns):
the ancestral chromosome comes from the AEK-717 collinear block that covers the gene, or, where no
AEK block covers it, from the majority label of the 10 nearest anchors of the 717-P. trichocarpa
v3.1 collinear block covering it. Gamma copy (1-3) and salicoid copy (1-2) are always named through
that P. trichocarpa block, from Wang et al.'s published P. trichocarpa painting. Where the AEK block
and the P. trichocarpa naming disagree on the chromosome, no copy is given. Copy numbers are Wang et
al.'s completeness ranks within one ancestral chromosome, not subgenomes.

Two tables, HAP1 and HAP2 kept apart (every row carries its haplotype, nothing is summed across):
  karyotype_route_c.tsv.gz          one row per assessed gene. The assessment covers the 19
                                    chromosomes, so the 131 HAP1 unplaced-scaffold genes are absent.
  karyotype_route_c_anchors.tsv.gz  genes that are direct collinear anchors of an AEK gene, with
                                    the slot (gamma copy x salicoid copy) they occupy. Upstream keeps
                                    only labelled anchors on the AEK gene's own chromosome.
Only what the site shows is copied. The *_pt / *_vv helper columns are read for gate 2 and dropped,
except the P. trichocarpa label support; anchor block ids and AEK ranks are dropped too, and a gene
anchored to the same AEK gene from two blocks is listed once.

GATES, all before anything is written:
  1. every gene is an atlas gene of the file's haplotype on the chromosome the atlas places it, and
     the assessed set is exactly the atlas's chromosomal genes
  2. route C re-derived from the helper columns equals aek_c / gamma_c / salicoid_c / the conflict flag
  3. coverage equals the owning analysis's published painting_v3_route_agreement.csv
  4. every anchor's slot equals its gene's own route C label, and the occupancy rebuilt from the
     anchors equals the published "any anchor" rows of salicoid_on_gamma_both_sisters.csv, cell for cell

Reads the OneDrive MS1_2026 tree, so like make_kaks_source.py it is NOT a build_all.sh stage: the
committed sources/ files are the artifact. Re-run by hand when route C changes upstream, then run
scripts/patch_karyotype.py and scripts/build_facets.py.
