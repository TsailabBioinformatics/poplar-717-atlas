"""ComBat-seq batch-corrected TPM, as a per-gene OPT-IN second view (TODO 18).

Not a rebuild. The v7 ComBat-seq matrix already covers the current 652-sample, current
gene-ID space -- the earlier "needs a 63,960-gene rebuild" read on this was wrong, corrected
here after actually joining the two: 0 sample mismatches (652/652, exact join on the
metadata's own `column` field), 0 gene-naming mismatches after stripping the trailing
transcript-style suffix (`PtXaTreH.T003800.1` -> `PtXaTreH.T003800`).

**The 59,599 vs 63,960 gene gap is NOT the atlas set changing under it.** It is 4,361 genes
that never entered the ComBat-seq run because of an upstream low-count filter, confirmed
quantitatively, not assumed: those 4,361 have a median max-TPM of 0.84 across all 652
samples (91.2% never exceed 5 TPM anywhere), against 26.73 (11.2% under 5 TPM) for the
59,599 that made it in. ComBat-seq's negative-binomial model needs count signal to fit;
near-zero genes get dropped before it runs, not after.

So this is per-gene ELIGIBLE, not universal. A gene without enough signal to batch-correct
has no ComBat value, and the site must not offer the option on that gene's page -- there is
nothing to show, not an error to hide. Eligibility is the presence of `x.cb` in the shard.

Output, sized like the raw buckets: `data/expr/combat_buckets/{hap}/{n}.json`, same bucket
keys as the existing raw buckets (`x.b`), so a ComBat sub-bucket is a subset of its raw
counterpart's genes, not a new bucketing scheme to keep in sync.
