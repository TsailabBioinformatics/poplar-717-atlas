// Module registry. Adding a module = import it here, push it into MODULES, and -- if it draws

// The contract, all fields optional except id/label:
//   id        stable slug, used in URLs
//   label     display name
//   geneCard(gene, manifest) -> HTMLElement | null   a card on the gene page. `manifest`
//                is always passed (small, already fetched for the page); most modules ignore it.
//   overview(manifest) -> HTMLElement      the module's own landing view
//   filters   [{id, label, test(gene, value), options|range}]  facets for the query builder
//
// Modules MUST NOT import one another. Cross-module interaction goes through geneset.js.

// order the modules happened to be imported -- so a promoter motif prediction could sit above
// the duplication class, and the expression summary landed near the bottom. This list is the
// running order, and it is ordered by WHAT THE EVIDENCE IS, not by what is interesting:

//   identity / duplication / synteny / expression   measured on THIS assembly
//   predicted                                       inferred, predicted, or carried over from

// partway should have stopped before the weakest evidence, not in the middle of it.

// The bands above ORDER the page by evidence, but every card still looked equally
// authoritative, so the order was invisible unless you already knew it was there: a
// phylostratigraphic rank rendered with the same visual confidence as a measured expression
// profile. Each card now states where its evidence came from, three ways at once -- a chip in
// words, the style of its left rule, and a recessed fill for the weakest tier -- so the
// distinction survives greyscale, colour-vision deficiency and a printed page:
//
//   tier 1  solid rule    measured in 717 samples, or read off the assembled genomes
//   tier 2  dashed rule   measured in another species and carried here by orthology
//   tier 3  dotted rule,  a prediction from sequence, an inference by homology, or a value
//           recessed      that depends on the database it was searched against
//
// Keyed by each card's data-card stamp (app.js). Stamps are per CARD, not per module: a module
// that draws several cards stamps the extra ones itself (annotation.js, promoter.js, locus.js),
// because one module's cards can sit in different tiers -- the promoter scan is a prediction
// and the chromatin beside it is a measurement in P. trichocarpa. A card with no entry here is
// reported as a console error, which fails the render checks, so a new card cannot quietly
// arrive looking like a measurement.
